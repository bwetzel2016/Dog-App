## Description

This project centers around the creation of appointments for a robot dog named Daisy through a user-friendly Rails application. The application not only allows users to create posts but also incorporates the use of their face photo for advanced facial recognition capabilities. By implementing this functionality, the project aims to provide an enhanced user experience and showcase the potential of facial recognition technology within the context of appointment scheduling.
